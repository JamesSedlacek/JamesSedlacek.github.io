Hi guys,

I'm James Sedlacek. This is my website for my iOS portfolio. 

I used a template from HTML5UP.net (stellar).

Finally got to use some of the HTML, CSS, & JS that I learned in my webpage authoring course in college.

If you have any feedback, feel free to get in contact with me via Email, Text, LinkedIn, etc.
